# Agentic AI Framework with MCP Support

Welcome to **Agentic AI**, an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to build advanced AI agents with first-class **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration and a plug-in tool system.  
The project is intentionally lightweight, transparent, and extensible so that researchers, hobbyists, and companies alike can experiment with multi-agent architectures, reasoning strategies, and external toolchains such as **Zapier** or **n8n**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modular Architecture** – Clean folder layout (see below) inspired by the included project diagram.
* **MCP-Native** – Agents speak MCP out of the box so they can interoperate with any compliant server, including Zapier AI Actions and n8n MCP nodes.
* **Tool Registry** – Register new capabilities (search, calculations, retrieval, etc.) in a single line of code.
* **FastAPI Sandbox** – Spin up a local HTTP API (`uvicorn src.app:app --reload`) and talk to your agent from the browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
* **Config-as-YAML** – Tweak model names, prompts, logging levels, and more without touching the code.
* **Batteries Included** – Sample prompts, simple reasoning engine, and working Zapier/n8n connectors so you can see end-to-end flows immediately.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ZouhairMudakka/open-aiagent-mcp.git
$ cd open-aiagent-mcp

# 2. Create virtualenv (optional but recommended)
$ python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Launch local API (runs on http://localhost:8000)
$ python run_server.py
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore the interactive Swagger UI.

## 🛠️ Using the Agent

```python
from src.agents.base_agent import Agent

agent = Agent()
response = agent.chat("Translate 'hello world' into Arabic and schedule via Zapier")
print(response)
```

### Zapier & n8n Connectors

The connectors live in `src/mcp/connectors`.  
Both classes expose a `call_tool()` method that converts agent requests into
HTTP calls against the respective MCP server endpoints. Configure your API keys
in the `.env` file or environment variables:

```
ZAPIER_API_KEY=your_key_here
N8N_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
